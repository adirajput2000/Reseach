#AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process)

Analytic Hierarchy process is a multi-criteria decision making method introduced by Prof. Thomas Saaty in 1970.
"It is a way to help decision makers make informed decisions by quantifying subjective beliefs within Mathematics framework.

The Process:
Step 1: Define the ultimate goal of the process
Step 2: List the various option you have to fulfil the goal.
Step 3: List the different criteria by which you asses the above alternative.
Step 4: Build the hierarcy from step 1 to step 3. 
Step 5: Pairwise comparision of each criteria and sub-criteria to establish their weights.
Step 6: Pairwise comparision of each criteria against each sub-criteria to establish their weights.
Step 7: Global summation of all these weight for each alternative and ordering them on the basis of the weighted sum
Step 8: Calculater the consistency ratio. This is a measure of how consistent the subjective assesment is.

The keyword of AHP is *Pairwise Comparision*.
